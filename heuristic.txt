The utility function rewards successor states based on wether or not a streak
greater or equal to 3 can form (with larger completed streaks being rewarded
more). My evaluation function considers this in addition to rewarding successor
states that eliminate any potential counter-play. For example, it is better to
fill a space that blocks an opponent from scoring multiple streaks than it is
to fill a space that scores you a minor streak. To do this, I replace all
blanks with the opposite player's pieces, thus over simulating the opponents
possible counter play moves. 

test_3 is a board designed to test if the computer will make blocking moves that
are more powerful than scoring moves. Minimax says the best move for player 2 in
this state is column 0, extending a 3 streak to a 4 streak (+7 points). My
heuristic says the best move is column 1 because it prevents player 1 from
forming 2 streaks of 3 (-18 points).
